### MOZILLA SCIENCE LAB LEARNING ROADMAP

####MISSION:  
Facilitating project-based learning around open data and open source  
1. We design accressible, reusable trainings and resources to help people share, use, and reuse research data, and teach these skills.  
2. We develop strategies and processes for working open that can be used in projects across reserch practice.  
3. We hold events for project-based learning and collaboration.

####2016 GOALS
* Survey and evaluate existing training offerings on "open" (see in-process list here: <https://public.etherpad-mozilla.org/p/sciencelab-other-open-trainings>
* Define some working process for curriculum/learning experience design
* Identify/collate best practices for working open, open data, facilitation and teaching
* Define a "like Mozilla" voice/style/approach or spin for our learning materials
* Develop core curriculum/learning experiences for target audiences (fellows, OLC, Study Groups); whenever possible develop materials collaboratively with our communties (in sprints and via study groups)
* Test and refine best formats and modes for delivering our materials; create reusable templates
* Align curriculum approach and production with curriculum work across Mozilla
* Find overlaps between Fellows curriculum and Open Leaders Cohort resources

#####Core Curriculum (Priorities)
* Open science 101 : big intro to possiblities for open in science, projects, mentions tools and platforms (non-technical)
* Working Essentials: how to do it. planning, making projects inviting, working with contributors, mentorship
* Open Data Basics: why, how of managing data so it's sustainable, reusable, reproducible/replicable
* GitHub for Open Collaboration: how to do this, and why, with lots of working open content 
* Event Handbooks
