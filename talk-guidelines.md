### TALK GUIDELINES/TIPS/TRICKS

#####Starting Off  
**Remember to introduce yourself.** Very briefly; who are you? why are you talking on this subject? What is your experience with it? Why is it important to you? Give your audience a way to know your connection to the material. 

for example: *"I'm Abby, Lead Developer for MSL. I started using tool x for collaboration x (weeks, months, days) ago... Tool x changed the way I work in really surprising ways, and so I'm excited we're learning tool x today.""*  

**State the question or topic you'll explore, and what you'll cover.** Give your audience a sense of the scale and scope of your talk, and what they'll get out of it.
 
for example: *""We're going to talk about why and how you'd share your data for re-use. We'll discuss three different scenarios for data reuse that you can implement in your projects."* 

**Start with a story or concrete example, give people something concrete to wrap their heads around** This could be an example of a success or a challenge or problem that the skill/topic/info you're discussing might address. You may ask the audience to come up with this example. 

for example: *"What does collaboration mean to you-- what are examples of colllaborative behaviors you've experienced or tried?"*
 
####Crafting your talk
**Ensure you are using accessible/shared languge.** 
Be sure to define all terms that might be unfamiliar to your audience as those words come up, or run through to a glossary of terms you'll be using at the start of the talk. 

**Build in moments for the audience to participate and share.** 
Ask questions, give them an opportunity to respond, give an example, tell a story, define a term, or verbalize a concept in their own words.

**Use concrete examples whenever possible**
 Discussing a specific scenario or a several different scenarios about helps your audience understand and imagine how this information can be or is applied practically in the real world. Examples provide nuance and detail. 
 
**Think about sequence** 
What concepts are key for your audience to understand first, and what elements should you introduce later on? This isn't always obvious (and goes hand in hand with defining terms)--sometimes too much detail early on can be confusing, while early oversimplification means that the audience may be lost when the material becomes too complex. 

**Control the flow of information** 
Be sure pause to give people a break if you're covering dense material. Unpack more complex topics to give users time to understand them. Think of your talk as a variable flow--- don't send out a firehose of info all at once

**Zoom in or out as needed** 
If you are providing fine details, be sure to connect them to the bigger picture. Framing information in this way helps the audience place new information in a meaningful context.

**Make a good ending**
Be sure to wrap up your presentation with a summary or takeawawy, a zoom out back to big picture-- why this is important, and time for questions.

**Suggest next steps**
What might your audience do next with this information or skill? Are there further trainings or opportunities available that they can take advantage of? 


####About Slide Decks and Visuals
Try not to read blocks or lists of text off your slides. This puts people into a focused reading mode, and your presence becomes unnecessary. Slides should not contain more than a sentence or phrase or two summarizing the content you discuss/elaborate while the slide is shown. If you have a lot of stuff to say, break it out into several slides. Put the words in the presenter notes. 

Visuals/images that show what you are talking about are great! These can be diagrams, figures, graphs, visuals like logos or symbols, metaphorical images, photos of people doing/working on things, and fun stuff like memes.... All are useful in keeping the audience's attention and making information more memorable-- but the most important part of the presentation is what YOU say-- the slides should completment this, not compete with it!  

If more complex specific information is key, put it on a handout or post online for reference later. 

Instructional talks with lots of complex steps that people need to walk through may be best done in a workshop or small group format, you give a live demo, followed by people doing hands-on work with intermittent help/troubleshooting from you and any assistants.
