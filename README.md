# learning
##This is a repository for planning and working on Mozilla Science Lab learning materials.

We are creaing learning materials for our communities. 
For 2016, our primary audiences are:

* Mozilla Fellows for Science
* Open Leadership Cohort
* Study Groups
* General Curious Audiences


Each for learning resource we create, we must specify in advance: 

* the goal/need it meets  
* the audience or target user  
* the format/mode of delivery
* how it will be tested  
* how it will be revised  
* how it will be reused and shared widely  

The Curriculum Design Brief <need link here> is completed before any project begins and captures all this information.
