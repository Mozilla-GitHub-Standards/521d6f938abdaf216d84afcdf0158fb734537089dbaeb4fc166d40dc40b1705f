# learning
##This is a repository for planning and working on Mozilla Science Lab learning materials.

We create learning materials for and with our communities. 
[See our Roadmap for our plans for 2016.](https://github.com/mozillascience/learning/blob/master/plan/Roadmap.md)

Our primary audiences are:

* Mozilla Fellows for Science
* Open Leadership Cohort
* Study Groups
* General Curious Audiences

We aim to create learning resources with the following in mind: 

* the audience or target user 
* the goal/need it meets  
* the format/mode of delivery
* how we can involve our community in creating resources
* how the resource will be tested  
* how the resource revised/iterated on 
* how the resource can reused and shared widely
