# learning
##This is a repository for planning and working on Mozilla Science Lab learning materials.

We create learning materials for and with our communities. 
For 2016, our primary audiences are:

* Mozilla Fellows for Science
* Open Leadership Cohort
* Study Groups
* General Curious Audiences

Stuff we think about while creating resources:

* the audience or target user 
* the goal/need it meets  
* the format/mode of delivery
* how we can involve our community in creating resources
* how the resource will be tested  
* how the resource revised/iterated on 
* how the resource can reused and shared widely
